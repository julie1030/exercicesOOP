/* EXERCISE 1
TODO: Create a class beverage.
TODO: Create the properties color (string), price (float) and temperature (string) and also foresee a construct.
TODO: Have a default value "cold" in the construct for temperature.

Remember for now we will use properties and methods that can be accessed from everywhere.
TODO: Make a getInfo function which returns "This beverage is <temperature> and <color>."
TODO: Instantiate an object which represents cola. Make sure that the color is set to black, the price equals 2 euro and the temperature to cold automatically
 print the getInfo on the screen.
TODO: Print the temperature on the screen.

/* EXERCISE 2

TODO: Make class beer that extends from Beverage.
TODO: Create the properties name (string) and alcoholPercentage (float).
TODO: Foresee a construct that's allows us to use all the properties from beverage and that sets the values for name and alcoholpercentage.

Remember for now we will use properties and methods that can be accessed from everywhere.
TODO: Make a getAlcoholPercentage function which returns the alocoholPercentage.
TODO: Instantiate an object which represents Duvel. Make sure that the color is set to blond, the price equals 3.5 euro and the temperature to cold automatically.
TODO: Also the name equal to Duvel and the alcohol percentage to 8,5%
TODO: Print the getAlcoholPercentage 2 times on the screen in two different ways, print the color on the screen and the getInfo.

TODO: After fixing the errors. Change the color of Duvel to light instead of blond and also print this new color on the screen after all the other things that were already printed (to be sure that the color has changed).

/* EXERCISE 6

Copy the classes of exercise 2.

TODO: Create a function in beverage and use the constant.
TODO: Do the same in the beer class.
TODO: Print the output of these functions on the screen.
TODO: Make sure that every print is on a new line.
